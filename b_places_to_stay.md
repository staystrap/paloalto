Living in the bay area is really expensive. The bright side is there are usually a lot of offers and it is possible to find housing in a few days once you are there. Most people just get an Airbnb or Hostel for a week and look for a place to stay during that time. It's not cheap, but nothing will be cheap here ;)

The most helpful sites for finding offers are 
 - [craiglist](http://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/hhh?)
 - [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/)
