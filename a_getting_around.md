title: Getting around
---

Brisbanes central areas are very hard on cars. As if the high insurance and petrol
costs were not enough, parking is super expensive - A$25 and more for a single day.
For this reason, it is adviseable to take advantage of the widely available public
transport infrastructure.

# Public Transport
Brisbanes public transport is operated by [translink](http://translink.com.au).
Since public transport is also quite expensive, a *gocard*, which reduces fares to a high,
but acceptable level is adviseable. It can be bought on any CityCat or CityFerry.

## CityCat, CityFerry and CityHopper
On Brisbane River, ferries travel up and down the river every 20 minutes.
The CityCat is the fastest one with the biggest range, until the University Of Queensland
St. Lucia campus. CityFerries and CityHoppers service a similar area around the CBD.

All services are mostly on time, with the CityCat being the most expensive way to get around,
a single journey may cost up to A$5.60. CityFerries operate
at lower cost, but are still hefty with A$3 for trip from one station to the other.

For this reason, the CityHopper is very popular, since it operates for free,
servicing similar areas as the CityFerry. But it also operates less often than the CityFerry.
During peak hours, CityHoppers often reach their capacity and will not take on any more passengers.

## CityCycles
In the inner parts of Brisbane, i.e. CBD, South Bank, Westend and Kangaroo Points
you can hire bikes for short trips at stations. After you have paid an initial
subscription fee, the system allows you to use the bikes for free for 30 minutes (Any minute more will cost you!).
If you happen to work and live around the areas of operation, you should definitely [check it out](http://www.citycycle.com.au/).

## Buses
They are a fast way to get around - if they are on time.
For Lukas..? :D

## Trains
Are a good way to travel medium distances, since they operate reliable and are reasonably priced.
A trip from Brisbane central to Gold Coast, which is about 100km, takes around two hours and costs
between A$11 and A$14 (with *gocard*).
