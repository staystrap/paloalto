# Public Transport

There are many different ways to get around. Most people rely on a car. However during rush hours the traffic in the are gets really bad. So sometimes public transportation may be preferable. Also there are a lot of bike routes in the bay area and it almost never rains. So if you don't live to far from your work or school and want to be environmentally aware you can also get around with a bike ;)

## Public Bus

If you want to use the buses frequently it makes sense for you to get a VTA pass. When you have one you can get use all Buses in the Valley for free. However, if you only use it once in a while, you might as well just pay single rides. It's only 1-2$.

## BART

The BART is a commuter railway between Milbrae and San Francisco. You will use it especially for transportantion to the San Francisco International Airport.

## CalTrain

The CalTrain is the fastest (and noisiest) public transportation option. It connect San Jose and San Francisco and all Cities in between. A ride is usually between 8$ to 15$.

## Uber

Uber is a very common way of transporation in the Bay Area. The are basically available everywhere. Especially if your in a group of 2-5 persons it's often more convenient then everything else.

## Clipper Card

If you want to use BART, CalTrain and Buses frequently get a Clipper Card. It makes traveling with them much easier. You can load money on and then pay rides with the card easily. Also, if you work for a bigger company in the area check out, whether they grant you commuter checks. You can use them to charge your Clipper Card.
