Everyone is buisy working for the tech industry. So thanks to high salaries the rent prices are growing. The valley is only affordable if you have a well-paid job. This also effects the nightlife. Since only few poeple are out after midnight, bars close really early.

On the other side, the bay area offers many career and networking opportunities. And with San Francisco and San Jose right next to it you always have some options for going out. Moreover the pacific ocean for example in Santa Cruz or Pacifica is only an one hour drive away. It's (almost) always sunny, there are lots of parks and outdoor activites.

So the bay area is definetely worth to be checked out and can give you a unique experience.
